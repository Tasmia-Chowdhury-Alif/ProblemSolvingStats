### About This Repository

I started my DSA journey with C++ in November 2023 and have solved **558+ problems** across Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, Vjudge, CSES, and other platforms.  
Being part of **Phitron’s XPSC (Batch-4)** helped me stay consistent through contests, reviews, and upsolving.  
This repository brings together my **problem-solving stats — solve counts, ratings, and profiles — in one place for easy review.**
